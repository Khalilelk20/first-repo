There are four main ingredients in sweet French crêpes: milk, flour, eggs and butter. A little sugar (not too much) and pinch of salt are added just to enhance the flavour.

Sometimes, if we're feeling fancy, we'll add a little orange or lemon zest but there's no need as the toppings or fillings add to their flavour. Likewise, there is no baking powder or any other raising agent needed.
